# Lightweight Web Animations

---

## Why This Project?

Many developers rely on heavy animation libraries (like AOS -
Animate On Scroll) that can add up to 330KB to your bundle size,
even when you only need 1-2 animation effects. This can
significantly impact your website's loading time and performance.
